                <h1>Privacy Policy of My Stylist</h1>
								<p><strong>Effective Date: 01 Sep 24</strong></p>
								<p>MyStylist App, a creation of RoSe technologies ("My Stylist", "we", "us", or "our"),
									places the utmost importance on the privacy and security of its users ("User",
									"you", or "your"). This commitment is at the core of our operations and is reflected
									in this Privacy Policy. Here, we detail our stringent practices for the collection,
									use, safeguarding, and disclosure of information provided by you or gathered by us
									during your use of our mobile application (the "App"), specifically within the
									geographical confines of India. Our approach is designed to ensure compliance with
									the highest standards of privacy protection, reflecting our dedication to respecting
									and securing your personal information.</p>

									parental control mechanisms and mandate explicit parental or guardian consent,
									ensuring a secure and respectful platform for all.</p>
								<p>1.2.2. To assure the authenticity of our stylists and facilitate seamless
									interactions between users and stylists, we collect detailed information from
									stylists. This includes, but is not limited to, full name, Aadhar number (as a

									trust. Such comprehensive data collection is pivotal in maintaining the integrity
									and reliability of our service.</p>
								<p>1.2.3. In our quest to tailor our services and recommendations to your unique tastes
									and needs, we delve into collecting specific details about your style preferences,
									service expectations, and interests. This includes your preferred styles, favourite
									products, appointment preferences (such as preferred times and locations), and any
									specific needs or requests you might have. Gathering this nuanced information allows
									us to refine our offerings and ensure a truly personalised and satisfying
									experience, catering directly to your individual preferences and lifestyle.</p>
								<p>1.2.4. Upon receiving your explicit consent, we collect precise GPS location data
									from your device. This information is crucial for tailoring our services and
